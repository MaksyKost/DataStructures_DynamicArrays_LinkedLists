Implementation and benchmarking of Dynamic Arrays and Linked Lists (C++).

# Data Structures: Dynamic Arrays and Linked Lists

This repository was created for the Data Structures course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

## 📌 Goal
To implement and compare three data structures:
- Dynamic Array
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

## ⚙️ Implemented operations
- Add / Remove at:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Random position
- Search for a random value

## 🧪 Benchmarking
- Operation time measured for different structure sizes (e.g., 5000 to 100000 elements)
- Results are saved to `results/` as `.csv` files
- Visualized and analyzed in the final report

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Language: C++
- No STL containers used
- Structures created from scratch
